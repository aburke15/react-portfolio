            I am a die hard tech enthusiast with a passion for learning. I have
            worked in the tech industry for over 5 years and have a solid
            background in software development. Although I have experience in
            both front and back end development, I am currently specialized in
            back end development. My goal is to build top quality software that
            is easy to use and easy to maintain. I hope to accomplish this by
            keeping up with tested architecture/development practices and the
            latest technologies. Please visit my links below to see my work and
            social profiles. I would love to connect with you!
